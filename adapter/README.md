## Adapter Design Pattern

The adapter design pattern solves these problems:

* How can a class be reused that does not have an interface that a client requires?
* How can classes that have incompatible interfaces work together?
* How can an alternative interface be provided for a class?

We have 2 clasess.the dont share the same inteface
so doffernet methods

so we creat an adapter, that uses the smae mothod names, 
cool
