## Decorator Design Pattern

The decorator pattern is a structural pattern, that allows you to attach additional responsibilites to an object at run time.

The decorator pattern is used in both the Object Oriented and Functional paradigms.

The decorator pattern is different than the Python language feature of Python Decorators in it's syntax, but the the application of it is the same, in the way that it is essentially a wrapper.

The Decorator pattern adds extensibility, without modifying the original function.
