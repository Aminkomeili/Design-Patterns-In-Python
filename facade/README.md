## Facade Design Pattern

The Facade is similar to the builder, but rather than giving you options, and the call the build method, it just creates.

A Facade is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired.
Alternatively, an adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior. 
A decorator makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time. 

The facade pattern is typically used when 
a simple interface is required to access a complex system,
a system is very complex or difficult to understand,
an entry point is needed to each level of layered software, or
the abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.

Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern
